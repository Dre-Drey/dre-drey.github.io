## WHAT

That's my portfolio and my blog, both in one place ! The website is built in html and css and I have recently improved it with some JS to filter my projects.

## HOW TO USE IT

- :rocket: Click on the {blog} to follow my journey in the programming universe with a review of my readings, some reports on my apprenticeship.
- :construction_worker: Click on the {projets} to know more about my work (past, present and future).
- :penguin: Click on Mister Penguin to come back on my personal page to know more about me.

## ROADMAP

I am currently improving the site on several levels (expected to be finished in April):

- creation of an API to manage blog posts
- implementation of a form accessible only by the administrator to manage the posts
- redesigning the site in React
